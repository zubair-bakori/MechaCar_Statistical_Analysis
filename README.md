## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
The rise in global oil price has translated into higher prices at the pump and consumers are paying attention. For MechaCar to stay in the race as a vehicle of choice when it comes to fuel consumption, we would deisgn a study that measures fuel efficiency in both city and highway driving compared to that of its competitors:
  - Test metrics: miles-per-gallon (mpg) - city and highway
  - Null hypothesis: True if mpg=25-30
  - t-test would be used because it would give mean and p-values
  - Data needed: Manufacture_ID; City_Driving_mpg; Highway_Driving_mpg
